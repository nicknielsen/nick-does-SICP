# Nick Does Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

I've decided it's time: I'm going to work my way through the famed programming textbook, *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, or SICP for short. This repo will contain all my solutions to the exercises found in the book (and potentially some other stuff, like notes and other musings about the text).

# Okay... but why?
SICP is something that's been on my radar for a while. I first learned about the book from [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) back in late 2020, and I've played with the idea of diving into it since then. I've gone back and forth about whether I should keep working to master JavaScript, or whether I should move to a different programming language entirely. Recently, I've flirted with the ideas of learning Java, Python, or even C or C++. I even began a few online courses. But at the end of the day, what cut through all the noise was a desire to drill down to the first principles of programming.

# Who should care about this repo?
Literally no one, probably. If you're curious to see how I solved the exercises in the book, then feel free to take a look through the [exercises](./exercises) directory.
