Exercise 1.10: The following procedure computes a mathematicalfunction called Ackermannâ€™s function:(define (A x y) (cond ((= y 0) 0)       ((= x 0) (* 2 y))       ((= y 1) 2)       (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))))What are the values of the following expressions?(A 1 10)(A 2 4)(A 3 3)Consider the following procedures, where A is the proceduredefined above:1. (define (f n) (A 0 n))2. (define (g n) (A 1 n))3. (define (h n) (A 2 n))4. (define (k n) (* 5 n n))Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computedby the procedures f, g, and h for positive integer valuesof n. For example, (k n) computes 5n^2.

----

1. (f n) computes 2n.
2. (g n) computes 0 for n = 0, 2^n for n > 0.
3. (h n) computes 0 for n=0, 2 for n = 1, and 2^(2^(2^(2...(n times)))) for n > 1
